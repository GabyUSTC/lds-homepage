I'm a PhD student @ University of Science and Technology of China since Sep 2021, co-supervised by [Prof. Xiangnan He](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~hexn/) and [Prof. Fuli Feng](https://fulifeng.github.io/). My research interests lie in deep learning based methods for biology and medicine. Previously I actively researched in the field of Recommender System and Causal Inference.
