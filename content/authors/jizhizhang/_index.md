I am a 3-rd year PhD student at the USTC Lab for Data Science. My research interest mainly lies in the philosophy of recommender system and recommendation for social good. Recently, I have been impressed by the prowess of LLMs and have been exploring the potential of Large Language Model for Recommendation (LLM4Rec) while attempting to mitigate the potential risks associated with LLM4Rec. I have several publications that appeared in the top conferences like RecSys and ACL. My pastime in life involves delving into my latent interests. I have an affinity for nature and enjoy indulging in activities such as hiking, camping, and road trips.
